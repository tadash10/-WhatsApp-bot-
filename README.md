Additional Notes:

    Make sure to install the validators package if you haven't done so:

    bash

pip install validators

Set the environment variables VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY and WHATSAPP_API_URL before running the app. You can do this in your terminal like so:

bash

export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY='your_virustotal_api_key'
export WHATSAPP_API_URL='https://api.twilio.com/...'

Ensure your Flask app is running in an environment that can access the internet for API calls.
